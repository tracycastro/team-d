        <h2>About Team Deloitte</h2>
        <p>
          Team Deloitte is more than 200 cyclists and volunteers dedicated to
          ending MS forever. Each year from our Houston and Austin offices, we
          work to raise funds, build community and spread awareness about MS.
          From our dual-starts in Katy and Austin to the celebrations at our
          tent in La Grange, to rolling across the finish line at Kyle Field, we
          are out to make an impact and to have a great time doing it.

        <h2>About the Texas MS 150</h2>
        <p>
          The Texas MS 150 is the single largest fundraiser for Multiple
          Sclerosis in the world. Thousands of riders cover more than 150 miles
          to the College Station finish line, helped along by more than 3,500
          volunteers and tens of thousands of contributors and spectators. This
          year’s ride takes place on April 29th and 30th and is set to bring in
          more than $12 million dollars for the National MS Society. Everyone
          rides the Texas MS 150 for their own reasons, but we are united by one
          goal: a world free of MS.
